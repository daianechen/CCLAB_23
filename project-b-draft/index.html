        <p>  The interactive digital film strip is a journey of all the places I have visited within China through my camera lens.
            As I am about to graduate, this project serves as a tangible imprint for me to reflect on my experiences and reminisce about my time in China.

            <h1> Guangdong 广东 </h1>
            <p>
                Located on the southern coast of China, Guangdong is where my family is originally from. 
                Mostly known for Cantonese cuisine, roasted meats, fresh seafood, and flavorful soups, 
                Cantonese food always reminds me of home. During my visit there, I had way too much dim sum to count 
                and played chess with my grandpa!

            <p> 
                Guilin, situated just a few hours away from Guangdong, is known for its breathtaking landscapes, rivers, and diverse topography. Despite our brief five-day visit, 
                my sister and I immersed ourselves in the exquisite flavors of Guilin rice noodles, a local specialty that left a lasting impression. 
                Our adventure included bamboo rafting, visits to the twin pagodas, the iconic Elephant Trunk Hill, the mesmerizing rice terraces, and even a thrilling hot air balloon ride. 
                Since I couldn't return home during my freshman year summer, this experience cured my homesickness!

            <h1> Hangzhou 杭州 </h1>
            <p>
                Despite its proximity to Shanghai, I still hadn't had the chance to visit Hangzhou. This semester, my friend Anna and I decided to take a one-day excursion to 
                Hangzhou, which turned out to be among the most enjoyable day trips I've experienced. We marveled at expansive rice terrace fields, enjoyed a scenic boat ride on West Lake, and successfully climbed to the pinnacle of the 
                Pagoda. Throughout the day, we relished a delightful view of the rice terraces as we savored pasta, and later, paused for a refreshing coffee break. We ended off the trip with delicious Beijing Peking Duck before we took the last train back to Shanghai.

            <h1> Gouqi Island 枸杞岛 </h1>
            <p>
                Despite the boat and bus sickness, this was such a memorable trip with my friend Celia. Gouqi Island,  is roughly 4 hours away from Shanghai, and known for their abandoned "Wizard of Oz" villages and gouqi berries. Every meal we
                 ate at local restaurants with fresh fish and seafood from the sea. It was such a nice girls' trip to get away from everything and just be surrounded by nature. We even woke up at 4am to watch the sun rise together, 
                hiked in an abandoned village, and had coffee by the sea.

            <!-- <img src="images/film5.jpg" alt=""> -->
            <p>
                This past Thanksgiving break, I went to visit Zhangjiajie which is located in the Hunan province and known for its "Avatar" mountains. This was such a unique experience since it was my first time taking the overnight sleep train and for someone who is scared of heights.
                I walked across the largest and longest glass bridge and rode in both the longest cableway in the world and tallest outdoor elevator in the world. Though it was scary and adrenaline rushing in the moment, it was probably one of the coolest things I've done in my life.

            <h1> Shanghai 上海  </h1>
            <p>
                Shanghai is one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities known for their towering skyscrapers and skylines. It has been my home for the past 3 years and has become one of my favorite places of all time. There is always something to do whether it be a new neighborhood to explore, a new restaurant/cafe to try, or even an art museum to visit.
                There has been no place like Shanghai with such a unique and rich history. For me, Shanghai is the starting point where I began to feel connected to my Chinese roots.
