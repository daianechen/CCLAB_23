    <p>To conclude my final year in college, I want this project to be a memorable 
    conclusion for my time in China. My idea is to feature an interactive film roll showcasing a 
    combination of my travel photos with interactive elements such as images and sounds through user interaction. This interactive film roll 
    is inspired by my travel adventures within China and my passion for photography. The photos serve as a memory 
    keeper for me to look back on my memories whenever I am nostalgic. Throughout my time in China, aside from Shanghai, I have 
    traveled to Hangzhou, Guilin, Zhangjiajie (Hunan), Gouqi Island, and Guangdong. These are all places you will find be able
    to find and look through in my film camera roll</p>
