            "STUDYING IN CHINA: ENDLESS MEMORIES"
            <br>
        </h1>
        <p> My college experience studying in China has been anything but normal. Unbounded by the language barrier, I have tried to connect and learn more about the
            places within China to understand more of my cultural roots. Through this journey, I have broken the misconceptions I have held and learned throughout my life and viewed the world 
            through my own lens, my camera lens. 

            The following interactive digital film strip is dedicated to showcase all the beautiful cities and regions I have visited in China thus far: Hangzhou, Guilin, 
            Zhangjiajie, Gouqi Island, Guangdong, and of course, Shanghai. Although there are so many more places to explore, I am afraid my time will be up within a few 
            months leading to graduation. Regardless, I hope to leave a mark through this website to represent the effect that these past few years have meant to me in a 
            place I now call home. The photos serve as a memory keeper for me to look back on whenever I am feeling nostalgic.
