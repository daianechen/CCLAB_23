            This project serves as a tangible imprint, allowing me to reflect on my experiences and reminisce of my time in China.

            <h1> Guangdong 广东 </h1>
            <p>
                Located on the southern coast of China, Guangdong is where my family is originally from. 
                Mostly known for Cantonese cuisine, roasted meats, fresh seafood, and flavorful soups, 
                Cantonese food always reminds me of home. During my visit there, I had way too much dim sum to count 
                and played chess with my grandpa!

            <h1> Guilin 桂林 </h1>
            <p> 
                Guilin is a couple of hours away from Guangdong and known for its breathtaking landscapes, rivers, and topography. Although my sister and I were only there for five days, I had so much Guilin rice noodles (their specialty dish) to last me a lifetime. I went bamboo rafting, 
                visited the twin pagodas, the elephant trunk hill, the beautiful rice terraces, and even flew on a hot air balloon. Since I wasn't 
                able to go home freshman year summer, this definitely cured my homesickness!

            <h1> Hangzhou 杭州 </h1>
            <p>
                For some reason, I haven't been able to visit Hangzhou even though it's so close by Shanghai so I made sure to take the trip this semester.
                I went with my friend Anna for a one day trip to Hangzhou and it was one of the nicest day trips I have done. We saw more rice terrace fields, took a boat ride on the west lake, 
                and even climbed up all the way up to the top of the Pagoda. Throughout the day, we had the loveliest view of the rice terrace while having pasta, before we stopped for a coffee break.

            <p>
                Aside from the boat and bus sickness, this was such a memorable trip with my friend Celia. We went to Gouqi Island which is roughly 4 hours away from Shanghai by bus and boat. Aside from the overpriced cab fares, 
                we ate at local restaurants with fresh fish and seafood from the sea. It was such a nice girls' trip to get away from everything and just be surrounded by nature. We even woke up at 4am to watch the sun rise together, 
                hiked in an abandoned village, and had coffee by the sea.

            <h1> Zhangjiajie 张家界 </h1>
            <!-- <img src="images/film5.jpg" alt=""> -->
            <p>
                This past Thanksgiving break, I went to visit Zhangjiajie, located in the Hunan province. This was such a unique experience since it was my first time taking the overnight sleep train. Zhangjiajie is known for its "Avatar" mountains,
                largest and longest glass bridge, longest cableway in the world, and tallest outdoor elevator in the world. As someone who is scared of heights, this was definitely a one of a kind experience that
                I had to push myself. Though it was scary and adrenaline rushing, it was probably one of the coolest things I've done in my life and I have no regrets.

            <h1> Shanghai 上海  </h1>
            <p>
                Shanghai, one of the world's most cosmopolitan cities known for their towering skyscrapers and skylines, has been my home for the past 3 years. One of my favorite places of all time, I still have so much to explore within Shanghai but I have had so many memories of the life I have built here.
                There has been no place like Shanghai with such a unique and rich history. For me, Shanghai is the starting point where I began to feel connected to my Chinese roots.
